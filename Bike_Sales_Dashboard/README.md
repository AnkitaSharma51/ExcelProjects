<h1> 🟪 Bike Sales Dashboard </h1>
The project involved analyzing sales data to create a detailed annual report. First, the data was cleaned by removing duplicates and correcting labels. Next, new features were created, such as age group and month, to aid in segmentation. Pivot tables were built to analyze metrics like average income per purchase, customer commute distance, and sales by age and region. These tables were integrated into a dashboard with interactive filters and slicers. Finally, past trends were analyzed to forecast future sales, allowing for more targeted marketing efforts.
